            <p class="bodPar">This is some bullshit about James and how he never felt like he fit in anywhere as a kid but one day he discovered hip-hop and his life changed for ever. Also how no one in Ogden beleived in him and thought a white kid could never be a rapper who would steal their hearts and now he is a local god and Kaitlyn has to beat woman away with brass knuckles cause their always trying to hop on his...phat rhymes.</p>

            <p class="bodPar">  This is some bullshit about Brandon and how he grew up getting all the girls and had a bunch of money and how he really just wanted to be a purist and dedicated his life to music and now he gets more money and girls than ever. He also makes a stab at how James would still be writing weak rhymes in his mom's basement if it wasnt for brandon. Also that he has a hero named Max Larson who inspired him to do everything he does now.</p>
